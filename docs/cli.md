# CLI reference

```
ft <command> [args]
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ft serve` | Start the API server (OpenAI `/v1/*`, Anthropic `/v1/messages`, Responses) |
| `ft shell` | Chat with a server in the terminal |
| `ft ctl` | Query and manage a running server over HTTP |
| `ft launch` | Configure and launch a coding agent against a server |
| `ft checkpoint` | Convert an HF checkpoint to the FTW fast-load format |
| `ft bench bw` | Benchmark CPU vs PCIe bandwidth to calibrate the MoE backend |

`ft --version` prints the installed version (torch-free; nightly wheels carry a
`+g<sha>` build stamp, tagged releases a bare version). Every command supports
`--help`.

## ft serve

```bash
ft serve --model <path-or-hf-id> [options]
```

`--model` is the only required flag — dtype, attention backend, MoE backend,
MoE cache size, KV capacity, CUDA-graph sizes and the tool-call/reasoning
parsers all resolve automatically from the checkpoint and the GPU.

### Model

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--model-path`, `--model` | required | Local dir, HF repo id, or an FTW dir (auto-detected) |
| `--served-model-name` | basename of `--model` | Model id reported by `/v1/models` |

### Server & runtime

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--host` | 127.0.0.1 | Bind address |
| `--port` | 1919 | Bind port |
| `--gpu` | GPU 0 | GPU to run on: a UUID from `nvidia-smi -L` or an `nvidia-smi` index; see [below](#choosing-a-gpu) |
| `--max-running-requests` | 4 | Max concurrently running requests |
| `--max-output-tokens` | 32768 | Default output budget for requests that omit one |
| `--max-seq-len-override` | from checkpoint | Max sequence length |
| `--max-prefill-length` | 8192 | Chunked-prefill chunk size in tokens |
| `--cuda-graph-max-bs`, `--graph` | = max running requests | Max batch size captured as CUDA graphs |
| `--decode-log-interval` | 40 | Scheduler status line every N decode steps |

### Choosing a GPU

For example, a machine with an RTX 5090 and an RTX 3060 Ti:

```console
$ nvidia-smi -L
GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti (UUID: GPU-2f3a9b1c-8d7e-4a05-b6c1-0e5f9a3d7b42)
GPU 1: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (UUID: GPU-9e8d7c6b-5a49-4f13-8207-c1b0a4e6d3f5)
```

```bash
ft serve --model ... --gpu 1             # by nvidia-smi index -- the 5090
ft serve --model ... --gpu GPU-9e8d7c6b  # the same card by UUID (a unique prefix is enough)
```

### KV cache & memory

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--memory-ratio` | 0.9 | Fraction of free VRAM the engine may use (weights + MoE cache + KV) |
| `--num-pages` / `--num-tokens` | auto | KV capacity override in pages / tokens (mutually exclusive; auto sizes from VRAM left after weights and MoE cache) |
| `--page-size` | 1 | KV page size; DSV4 forces 128, the TRTLLM backend needs 16/32/64, SWA models require 1 |
| `--cache-type` | radix | `radix` (prefix reuse; SWA/GDN-aware variants picked automatically) or `naive` |
| `--kv-cache-dtype` | bf16 | `bf16`, `fp8`, or `nvfp4` (see [NVFP4 KV cache](#nvfp4-kv-cache)): FP8 stores the KV cache as e4m3 codes plus one fp32 scale per (token, kv head), roughly doubling the tokens that fit in the same VRAM; see [FP8 KV cache](#fp8-kv-cache) |
| `--attention-backend`, `--attn` | auto | `trtllm`/`fi`/`fa`/`triton`/`dsv4_sparse`/`dsa`; `prefill,decode` pair allowed; auto picks per model + GPU |

### FP8 KV cache

`ft serve --kv-cache-dtype fp8` halves the bytes per cached token (8-bit codes instead
of 16), so a card that held N tokens holds close to 2N. Each `(token, kv head)` row
keeps its own fp32 scale, which costs ~3% back at `head_dim=128`. Requirements and
trade-offs:

- Needs an attention backend that applies the scales: **triton** for the plain paged
  and hybrid-SWA pools, `qsa_sparse` for QSA, `dsa` for MLA/DSA. `--attn auto` selects
  one (and refuses an explicit `fi`/`fa`/`trtllm`, which cannot be shown to apply these
  scales).
- Works on the plain paged, hybrid-SWA, QSA sparse (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next) and MLA/DSA
  latent KV pools (GLM-5.2, GLM-5.3-Flash). On QSA the block-selection index keys stay
  16-bit; only the selected K/V rows are read back as codes. On MLA/DSA the DSA kernel
  dequantizes the selected latent rows with their per-token scale while the index-key
  and tail tiers stay 16-bit. DeepSeek-V4's tiered pool and the block-sparse
  MiniMax-M3 pool stay 16-bit; asking for fp8 there fails at startup rather than
  silently ignoring the flag.
- The same bytes on every GPU FreeToken targets: the codes sit in a plain byte buffer
  and are decoded in software, so the cache holds identical data and produces identical
  numbers on any card (the fp8 type is deliberately kept out of the kernels, which is
  also what makes the feature work on the RTX 30 series).
- Accuracy is checkpoint-dependent. Expect it to matter most on long contexts and on
  models with outlier key channels; keep `bf16` when a run must be bit-reproducible.
- `ft ctl stats` / `/v1/cache/status` report the smaller `kv_bytes_per_token`, and
  `ft ctl cache --kv N` moves the same (now cheaper) pool.

### MoE offload

See [models.md](models.md#moe-strategies) for what each strategy does.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--moe-strategy` | auto | `fused`/`offload`/`cpu`/`hybrid`; auto → offload, or hybrid with a `ft bench bw` profile. `--moe-backend` is the deprecated old spelling |
| `--quant-backend` | auto | Kernel per quantized layer type, `layer[.kind]=name` entries: `linear=marlin,moe=b12x` or `moe.nvfp4=triton`. A layer-level entry applies to every kind whose table lists the name |
| `--nvfp4-backend` | — | Deprecated: stands in for `--quant-backend moe.nvfp4=<marlin\|b12x\|triton>` (`flashinfer` means b12x); cannot be combined with `--quant-backend` |
| `--moe-cache-size` / `--moe-cache-rate` / `--moe-cache-auto` | auto | GPU expert-cache size as slots / fraction of all experts / sized from free VRAM (mutually exclusive; auto is enabled by default for offload-family strategies) |
| `--kv-reserve-tokens` | 8192 | KV token floor reserved before `--moe-cache-auto` fills experts |
| `--moe-cpu-threads` | physical cores | CPU worker threads for the cpu/hybrid executor |
| `--moe-cpu-layers` | all on GPU | With `offload`: which MoE layers decode on CPU (`3,7,11`, a count, a fraction, or `auto`). `auto` is for Windows/WSL only, where CUDA pinned memory is capped; every value needs an expert format the CPU executor serves (bf16, nvfp4, mxfp4), so fp8 experts cannot use it |
| `--moe-hybrid-max-fetch` | auto | With `hybrid`: max experts fetched over PCIe per layer per step; rest computed on CPU |
| `--moe-prefill-hit-d2d` | off | Prefill: copy cache-hit experts device-side, stream only misses (CUDA >= 13) |
| `--disable-moe-prefill-overlap` | overlap on | Disable the two-buffer prefill copy overlap |

### API behaviour

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--sampling-defaults` | model | Fill unspecified sampling params from the checkpoint's `generation_config.json` (`none` = framework defaults) |
| `--tool-call-parser` | auto | Tool-call format; auto-inferred from the model family |
| `--reasoning-parser` | auto | Splits chain-of-thought into `reasoning_content`; auto-inferred; `off` disables |
| `--enable-cache-report` | off | Report prefix-cache hits in each response's usage block |

### Image input

Experimental. Needs a checkpoint whose family registers a vision encoder ([models.md](models.md#image-input) lists them and how each one
maps the flags below); a request carrying images is rejected otherwise. Images are accepted on all three protocols (OpenAI `image_url`,
Anthropic `image` blocks, Responses `input_image`) as an http(s) URL or base64. Images inside a tool
result (an Anthropic `tool_result` block from Claude Code's Read, a Responses `function_call_output`
from Codex's view_image) are moved to the user turn that follows the tool message, as vLLM does,
because chat templates render tool messages as plain text.
`GET /v1/stats` reports what the server accepts as `model.input_modalities` (`["text"]` or `["text", "image"]`),
so a client can gate its attachment controls without reading the checkpoint config.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--text-model-only` | off | Serve a multimodal checkpoint text-only: no encoder tower is built (its VRAM goes to the KV/expert pools) and every multimodal input is rejected. Same as `--mm-disable` with every encoder kind |
| `--mm-disable` | none | Encoder towers to leave unbuilt (`vision`, `audio`); every input they would serve is rejected |
| `--mm-encoder-weights` | host | Where the encoder tower's block weights live. `host` streams them from pinned host banks two blocks at a time behind the compute, so the GPU holds two blocks instead of the whole tower; small images pay the copy time, large ones hide it behind the compute. `gpu` keeps them resident. An encoder without a block stack stays resident either way |
| `--image-min-tokens`, `--image-max-tokens` | processor defaults | Per-image token budget: the image processor resizes every image to take between these many tokens, converted to the family's own units by its processor. A family with fixed budgets honors the maximum only and refuses one below its smallest budget at start-up |
| `--mm-processor-kwargs` | none | JSON object of extra keyword arguments for the checkpoint's image processor call, for knobs the token budget does not cover; applied after the budget, so an explicit key wins |
| `--mm-embed-cache-device` | cpu | Where encoded image embeddings live between prefill chunks. `cpu` keeps them out of the VRAM budget; `cuda` skips the copy back |
| `--allowed-media-domains` | any | Comma-separated hostname allowlist for image URLs; requests for other domains are rejected with a 400. Empty allows any domain |
| `--allowed-local-media-path` | off | Directory `file://` image refs may be read from; unset rejects local files |

## ft shell

```bash
ft shell                                    # attach to a running server
ft shell --model ~/models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B   # serve + chat in one process
```

- Attach mode talks to `--server URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:1919`)
- `/help` inside the shell lists the commands (`/think`, `/cache`, `/reset`).

## ft ctl

```bash
ft ctl [--base-url http://127.0.0.1:1919] [--timeout 10] [--json] <subcommand>
```

| Subcommand | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `health` | `GET /health` | Server status, model, load progress |
| `stats` | `GET /v1/stats` | Throughput, latency, VRAM, pool occupancy, accepted input modalities |
| `generate [prompt] [--max-tokens N] [--ignore-eos]` | `POST /generate` | Raw completion smoke test (no chat template) |
| `cache` | `GET /v1/cache/status` | Cache pool table |
| `cache --moe N \| --kv N \| --mamba N \| --swa N [--wait 300]` | `POST /v1/cache/rebuild` | Live pool resizing without a restart (`k`/`m` suffixes; `--kv`/`--swa` in tokens) |
| `requests [--since N] [--limit N]` | `GET /v1/requests` | Recent request ring |

The server also exposes `GET /ready` for readiness polling: 503 with a reason until the engine is serving with no fatal error, 200 after (`GET /health` always answers 200).

## ft launch

```bash
ft launch {claude,codex,dsh,hermes,openclaw,opencode} [options] [-- <agent args>]
```

Discovers the served model via `/v1/models`, writes the agent's provider
config, installs the agent CLI if missing, then launches it. Cloud API keys
(`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, …) are cleared from the child
environment so the agent cannot silently fall back to a paid endpoint.
When `/v1/stats` reports `image` among `model.input_modalities`, the written
config declares the model image-capable, which Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw and
dsh require before their image tools and attachments send anything; Claude
Code and Hermes need no declaration.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--server URL` | Server to point the agent at (default `http://127.0.0.1:1919`) |
| `--dry-run` | Print the planned config changes and command, touch nothing |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Approve install/config prompts |
| `--config` | Configure without launching |
| `--install-only` | Just install the agent CLI (needs no server) |
| `--force-reinstall` | Re-run the agent installer |
| `-- <args>` | Forwarded verbatim to the agent |

## ft checkpoint

```bash
ft checkpoint --model <hf_dir> --out <ftw_dir> [--dtype bfloat16] [--moe-backend offload] [--quant-backend moe.nvfp4=b12x] [--shard-gib 8] [--gpu <uuid-or-index>]
```

Converts an HF safetensors checkpoint to FTW, FreeToken's self-contained
fast-load format; point `ft serve --model` at the output dir. `--moe-backend
offload` (default) packs experts into offload banks; `--moe-backend triton`
keeps them dense for resident serving. See the FTW caveats in
[models.md](models.md#notes); FTW files from older builds can be repaired with
[scripts/ftw_hotfix.py](ftw-hotfix.md) instead of reconverting.

## ft bench bw

```bash
ft bench bw                       # once per GPU
ft bench bw --dtype nvfp4,bf16    # only the formats you serve
ft bench bw --gpu 1               # a specific GPU (UUID or nvidia-smi index, as for ft serve)
```

Measures host-RAM vs PCIe bandwidth with the real cpu/offload MoE kernels and writes a
profile that `ft serve --moe-strategy auto` and `--moe-hybrid-max-fetch -1` then read.

- One profile per GPU, at `~/.cache/freetoken/benchbw/<gpu-uuid>.json`.
- Keyed on expert format + GPU, so a profile from other hardware is ignored rather than
  misapplied. An older single `benchbw.json` still counts if its GPU name matches.
- What to measure: `--dtype`, `--model`, `--formats`, `--isa`.
- `--threshold` (default 2.0) sets the call: recommend hybrid when CPU bandwidth beats PCIe
  by that factor.


### NVFP4 KV cache

`ft serve --model <checkpoint> --kv-cache-dtype nvfp4 --attention-backend triton`
opts into packed E2M1 KV storage. The initial implementation supports plain paged
FULL attention (MHA/GQA), hybrid-SWA, and the full-attention portion of hybrid-linear
models, QSA, and MLA/DSA (including GLM-5.3-Flash). Head dimensions must be
divisible by 16. DSV4 and BSA pools are rejected at startup. `auto` selects
Triton, QSA sparse, or DSA attention for supported models. For MLA/DSA use
`--attention-backend auto` or `--attention-backend dsa`. Only the latent slab is
quantized; indexer keys, kpool tails/gates, and recurrent states retain their
existing precision. A 512-element latent row occupies 292 bytes instead of 1024
bytes in BF16, excluding those other tiers.

Each K or V row stores `head_dim / 2` packed bytes, `head_dim / 16` E4M3 block-scale
bytes, and one FP32 row scale. At head_dim 128 this is 76 bytes, versus 256 for
BF16 and 132 for the existing FP8 format. Pool management, recurrent states,
attention workspace and model weights consume additional memory.

The second-level scale is dynamic per token/head, so appending a token never
rescales an existing prefix. This is a FreeToken KV layout, not an external
NVFP4 checkpoint or attention-library ABI. K/V are restored inside attention;
Q and attention arithmetic retain their compute precision. The MoE weight option
`--nvfp4-backend` is independent. Paged MHA prefill uses fresh compute-dtype K/V
while cached prefixes are restored, as in the FP8 path. MLA/DSA stores fresh
latent rows first and reads the quantized cache in both prefill and decode.

NVFP4 is opt-in: assess quality on your checkpoint and workload before using it
for long-context inference. Capacity savings do not guarantee faster decode;
packing, reconstruction, and the selected attention backend affect throughput.
