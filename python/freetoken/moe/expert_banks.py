    the same normalized ``ExpertBanks`` and both pinning after fill:

    * **Fast path (FTW)**: if ``model_path`` is a converted FTW checkpoint, read its
      repacked banks directly (contiguous chunked O_DIRECT). No auto-conversion.
    * **Slow path** (the original checkpoint): auto-pick **parallel** (the common parallel chunked
      O_DIRECT reader) when experts are stored as many small tensors -- the serial read is
      slow there -- else the **serial baseline** (packed experts: serial already saturates,
      parallel only adds read amplification). parallel unavailable for a quant falls back to serial.

    ``parallel`` overrides the slow-path auto-pick: ``None`` = auto (production), ``True`` /
    ``False`` = force parallel / serial (used by the loader benchmark and the converter).

    ``layer_sink`` (the converter only): forwarded to whichever provider is picked; a
    provider only engages it (and reports ``ExpertBanks.streamed=True``) for its own
    streamable formats, so callers must check ``streamed`` rather than assume it fired.

    ``method`` (the bound expert quant method of the model's offload layers) selects
    the generic path: the family's pieces packed by the method's kernel. Without it only the
    GGUF q4_0 format loads, through its own provider.

    ``layer_residency``: per-layer ``HostResidency`` labels applied at settle time -- explicitly on the FTW fast path, ambiently (``requested_residency``) in the slow-path providers.
    Applied labels are echoed on ``ExpertBanks.layer_residency``; a loader that settles some other way leaves it ``None`` (CPU-layer decode still works on pinned banks, it just saves no pin quota).
