"""Backend startup/liveness supervision, decoupled from run_api_server so it is unit
testable without spawning real processes.

The scheduler/tokenizer worker processes are spawned by launch.start_subprocess, which
hands back a BackendHandle. ``drain_ready`` blocks until every worker has acked ready
(applying interleaved ("progress", desc, done, total) messages to a LoadProgress),
after which the caller flips the maintenance gate to "serving". Task 3 adds liveness
watching on top of this.
