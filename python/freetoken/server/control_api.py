"""Read-only control-plane endpoints consumed by the desktop app: /health (lifecycle),
/ready (readiness gate, 503 until serving), /v1/stats (runtime metrics, Task 6),
/v1/requests (request log ring, Task 5).

All handlers read a shared FrontendManager snapshot via ``get_state``; nothing here touches
the scheduler or blocks. Registered on the app alongside the OpenAI/Anthropic/Responses routes.
