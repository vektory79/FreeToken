"""State-machine tests for the runtime cache-rebuild maintenance gate (api_server).

dispatch_rebuild latches maintenance_state to "rebuilding"; the only ways back to a definite
state are the scheduler's reply (via FrontendManager._resolve_rebuild), a dispatch-time error,
or the liveness watchdog on a crash. These tests pin all three edge paths so a rebuild can
never wedge the server in "rebuilding" forever:

  1. dispatch exception   -> gate rolls back to "serving" (the scheduler never got the request)
  2. HTTP wait timeout    -> stays "rebuilding" on purpose, but the late reply still resolves it
  3. scheduler crash      -> the watchdog latches "failed", wakes the in-flight rebuild waiter
                             (so it fails promptly, not on timeout), and a buffered reply can't
                             undo the latch

They use a lightweight fake state exposing only the handful of attributes the code touches, so
no ZMQ / listener task / GPU is needed. _resolve_rebuild is exercised as an unbound method on
the fake — the real method logic, a stand-in ``self``.
